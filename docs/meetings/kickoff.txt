Kickoff Meeting: 17.July.2022

Old project: https://github.com/sueszli/dateWatch/

Goals:
    > Getting from "proof of concept" to a solid MVP
    > Making the user-experience better than using paper and pen (therefore as simple and frictionless as possible).

    Code manager:
        - Github private repository (also contains all meeting notes and docs)
    Frontend:
        - Vue3
        - Vant3 mobile first library
    Backend:
        > Ideally we want to avoid writing any backend code and want to rely on Supabase features as much as possible (see: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-vue-3#building-the-app).
        - Supabase (BaaS)
        - Java spring boot

Name of app:
    We can "DateWatch" because no one can sue us.
    Other possible options:
        - DateDriven
        - SpeeDate
        - IntelliDate
        - SwiftDate
        - DateBase
        - DateBased
        - DateStack
        - EnDate
        - DateBit
        - DataLove
        - MatchThree
        - FastMatch
        - SyncMatch
        - SpeedMatch
        - Speedup
        - WatchDate
        - Eko
        - DashMatch
        - QuickDate
        - UpDate
        - Matchy
        - MatchWatch
    Yahya's choices:
        - Matchy

Time budget:
    The project should be done until October.

Legal issue:
    Yahya's old SEPM group has not yet allowed him to reuse their old code (still waiting).

Revenue:
    Every cent of revenue will be split by two.
    Yahya is planning to either sell the entire app to a client or host speed-dating events on the "meetup" app.
