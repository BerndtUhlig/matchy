# Frontend

[Check out the frontend project guide](./frontend/README.md)

# Backend

As you probably noticed, we didn't write any backend and are using the BaaS called [supabase](https://supabase.com/).
Check out [this sweet demo](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-vue-3) to find out how to get started with vue and let me know what your email address is so I can give you access to our supabase workspace (haha that rhymes nicely).
