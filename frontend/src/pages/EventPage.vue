<template>
  A event ID lands in the URL and all info about the event should be displayed here. Also, if the user owns (aka has organized)
  the event, we should
  <ul>
    <li>in "user mode": show a "switch to organizer mode" button</li>
    <li>in "organizer mode": edit button and extra info</li>
  </ul>
</template>
