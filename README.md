Howdy friend! <br>
In this open source project, we're making speed dating paperless! üíå

> Sounds interesting? Feel free to put this project on your watch list by clicking the `watch` button above and coming back later when there is more progress made.

This [simplified mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/ClWUVCuVzjNAG4Gat5TO10/matchy-V2-(Read-Only)?node-id=9%3A1033) gives you an idea of where we're trying to get.
<br><br>

## Who is this for?
The main goal of this app is to provide existing non-profit speed friending organizations with a better alternative to pen and paper. We've already been asked by some of these communities to develop this app. Therefore we know with certainty that there already is some demand for it.
